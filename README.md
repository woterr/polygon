# Polygon - v2

After realizing that the previous bot had many MANY bugs, I decided to remake the commands and the website, the website is still under progress but the bot is updated, the new version will be public as soon as the website is complete.

## Features
- Better settings(setup) command: You can now use `/settings view` or `/settings edit` to view or configure the bot settings for your server
- Different collection for server settings and tickets: Previously, I had tickets and ticket system setup in the same collection, now it's seperated 
- Custom buttons: You can now add custom buttons to your ticket system
- Blacklist: The blacklist command has been updated! Blacklist command now has `duration`, `reason` and it even has mod logs!
- Managers: You can now choose who can manage tickets (lock, unlock, save & delete)
- No more annoying pings: Every message is either in an embed or is visible to you only, you will not get pinged by the bot while managing tickets
- Major bug fixes

Thats it for now, i'll add more updates soon!
